Delaunay Density Diagnostic
----------------
   Version 2.0, November 2023

   This code implements algorithms described in:\
   **Algorithm XXXX: The Delaunay Density Diagnostic**\
   under review at ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software\
   original title: ``Data-driven geometric scale detection via Delaunay interpolation''
   Andrew Gillette and Eugene Kur, 2022 \

Usage
----------------

1. Activate a python environment that includes the packages listed in the REQUIREMENTS.txt file.  

2. Ensure that the `gfortran` compiler is installed.

3. Run the driver script for the Griewank and/or static data examples:
   ~~~~
   python run_ddd_griewank.py
   ~~~~
   The above script will run a total of 100 trials of the `delaunay_density_diagnostic.py` script,
      using data from the 2D Griewank function.  The results are saved as `.csv` files.  Then the script `generate_ddd_figures.py` is called to generate a `.png` figure called `ddd-figure-griewank.png`.  The figure should match the file `ddd-figure-griewank-repo.png` that is contained in the repository.  More details can be found in the header of  `run_ddd_griewank.py`.

   A typical run time for a single trial is a few seconds, so the whole script should complete
      in 5-10 minutes.

   ~~~~
   python run_ddd_static.py
   ~~~~
   The above script will run a total of 100 trials of the `delaunay_density_diagnostic.py` script,
      using data from the static topography dataset described in the paper (and stored in the subfolder `staticdata/`).   The results are saved as `.csv` files.  Then the script `generate_ddd_figures.py` is called to generate a `.png` figure called `ddd-figure-static.png`.  The figure should match the file `ddd-figure-static-repo.png` that is contained in the repository.  More details can be found in the header of  `run_ddd_static.py`.


4. If the figures generates correctly, run
   ~~~~
   python delaunay_density_diagnostic.py --help
   ~~~~
   to see the command line options that can be added to the driver scripts for
   user-specified experiments.

Debugging notes
----------------

The package includes source files in Fortran that impmlement a version of TOMS Algorithm 1012:
DELAUNAYSPARSE.  This version that has been updated from the original submission to more easily allow python wrapping.  Running the script `delaunay_density_diagnostic.py` will compile the relevant files using `gfortran`.  

During compiling, this type of warning may occur:
~~~~
Warning: Rank mismatch between actual argument at (1) and actual argument at (2)
~~~~
This warning is issued by the `slatec` library that is included with the DELAUNAYSPARSE source code and is not easily suppressed.  However, this warning is only due to a change in Fortran conventions since the original publication of TOMS 1012 and does not cause any issues in regards to the results.
